## SceneManager

**Inherits:** None

Manages the stack of active scenes. Allows for scene transitions (replacing) and stacking (push/pop), useful for pausing or menus.

### Public Methods

- **`void setCurrentScene(Scene* newScene)`**
    Replaces the current scene with a new one.

- **`void pushScene(Scene* newScene)`**
    Pushes a new scene onto the stack, pausing the previous one.

- **`void popScene()`**
    Removes the top scene from the stack, resuming the previous one.

- **`std::optional<Scene*> getCurrentScene() const`**
    Gets the currently active scene, or std::nullopt if no scene is active.

## SceneArena (Memory Management)

**Include:** `core/Scene.h`

**Namespace:** `pixelroot32::core`

**Inherits:** None

An optional memory arena for zero-allocation scenes. This feature is enabled via the `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_SCENE_ARENA` macro. It allows scenes to pre-allocate a fixed memory block for temporary data or entity storage, avoiding heap fragmentation on embedded devices.

On ESP32, the main trade-off is:

- **Benefits**: predictable memory usage, no `new`/`delete` in the scene, reduced fragmentation.
- **Costs**: the buffer size is fixed (over-allocating wastes RAM, under-allocating returns `nullptr`), and all allocations are freed only when the arena is reset or the scene ends.

### Public Methods

- **`void init(void* memory, std::size_t size)`**
    Initializes the arena with a pre-allocated memory buffer.

- **`void reset()`**
    Resets the allocation offset to zero. This "frees" all memory in the arena instantly.

- **`void* allocate(std::size_t size, std::size_t alignment)`**
    Allocates a block of memory from the arena. Returns `nullptr` if the arena is full.
