## Music Data Structures

### MusicNote (Struct)

Represents a single musical note in a melody.

- **`Note note`**: Musical note (C, D, E, etc. or Rest).
- **`uint8_t octave`**: Octave index (0–8).
- **`float duration`**: Duration in seconds.
- **`float volume`**: Volume level (0.0 to 1.0).

### MusicTrack (Struct)

Represents a sequence of notes to be played as a track.

- **`const MusicNote* notes`**: Pointer to an array of notes.
- **`size_t count`**: Number of notes in the array.
- **`bool loop`**: If true, the track loops when it reaches the end.
- **`WaveType channelType`**: Which channel type to use (typically `PULSE`).
- **`float duty`**: Duty cycle for Pulse tracks.

### InstrumentPreset (Struct)

Simple preset describing a reusable "instrument":

- **`float baseVolume`**: Default volume for notes.
- **`float duty`**: Duty cycle suggestion (for Pulse).
- **`uint8_t defaultOctave`**: Default octave for the instrument.

#### Predefined Presets

- `INSTR_PULSE_LEAD` – main lead pulse in octave 4.
- `INSTR_PULSE_BASS` – bass pulse in octave 3.
- `INSTR_PULSE_CHIP_HIGH` – high-pitched chiptune pulse in octave 5.
- `INSTR_TRIANGLE_PAD` – soft triangle pad in octave 4.

#### Helper Functions

- **`MusicNote makeNote(const InstrumentPreset& preset, Note note, float duration)`**
- **`MusicNote makeNote(const InstrumentPreset& preset, Note note, uint8_t octave, float duration)`**
- **`MusicNote makeRest(float duration)`**

These helpers reduce boilerplate when defining melodies and keep instruments consistent.

## MusicPlayer

**Inherits:** None

High-level sequencer for playing `MusicTrack` instances as background music.
Music timing is handled internally by the `AudioEngine`.

### Public Methods

- **`MusicPlayer(AudioEngine& engine)`**
    Constructs a MusicPlayer bound to an existing `AudioEngine`.

- **`void play(const MusicTrack& track)`**
    Starts playing the given track from the beginning.

- **`void stop()`**
    Stops playback of the current track.

- **`void pause()`**
    Pauses playback (time does not advance).

- **`void resume()`**
    Resumes playback after pause.

- **`bool isPlaying() const`**
    Returns true if a track is currently playing and not finished.

- **`void setTempoFactor(float factor)`**
    Sets the global tempo scaling factor.
  - `1.0f` is normal speed.
  - `2.0f` is double speed.
  - `0.5f` is half speed.

- **`float getTempoFactor() const`**
    Gets the current tempo scaling factor (default 1.0f).

### Typical Usage

```cpp
using namespace pixelroot32::audio;

static const MusicNote MELODY[] = {
    makeNote(INSTR_PULSE_LEAD, Note::C, 0.20f),
    makeNote(INSTR_PULSE_LEAD, Note::E, 0.20f),
    makeNote(INSTR_PULSE_LEAD, Note::G, 0.25f),
    makeRest(0.10f),
};

static const MusicTrack GAME_MUSIC = {
    MELODY,
    sizeof(MELODY) / sizeof(MusicNote),
    true,
    WaveType::PULSE,
    0.5f
};

void MyScene::init() {
    engine.getMusicPlayer().play(GAME_MUSIC);
}
```
