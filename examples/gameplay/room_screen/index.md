# Room Screen

> **Demonstration project** — provided as an example of what the PixelRoot32
> Game Engine can do. It is not a product: parts may be incomplete,
> experimental, or deliberately simplified to keep one idea in focus.

A 4-room layout exported by the Tilemap Editor: four 15x15 rooms in a 2x2 grid (each 240×240 at 16 px/tile). A 16×16 hero (idle + two-frame walk, up/down/left/right) walks the world freely and collides with the Items layer (the collision layer). Crossing a room boundary follows the room connection — the camera snaps to the target room and the player lands on its entry edge; an unconnected edge acts as a wall.

Language: C++17

## Where the rooms come from

The graph is not hand-written in C++. `src/assets/roomscreen_main_scene.h` / `.cpp` hold the exported scene — tilemaps, palettes, and the room layer (tile-space rects plus connection slots) — and `Scene::init()` turns the room layer into a `RoomGraph<4>` with one call:

```cpp
gameplay::buildRoomGraph(ROOMSCREEN_MAIN_SCENE_ROOM_LAYER, rooms_);
```

That keeps rects and connections in one place instead of spread across `addRoom`/`connect` calls that can drift out of sync with the map. See [Tilemap Editor — Room Layer](https://github.com/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine/blob/main/docs/tools/tilemap-editor/technical-reference.md#room-layer) for the format.

## Requirements (build flags)

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_GAMEPLAY_ROOM=1` | Yes | Enables `RoomGraph<N>` |
| `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_AUDIO=1` | No | Audio backend for SDL2/ESP32 |

## Platforms

| Environment | Display | Audio |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `native` | SDL2 window, 240x240 | none — the demo sets no audio flag |
| `esp32dev` | ST7789 240x240 over SPI — MOSI **23**, SCLK **18**, DC **2**, RST **4**, CS **-1** | none |

## Controls

- **Up/Down/Left/Right arrow keys**: move the player. Walking into a wall stops you; walking across an open room boundary transitions to the connected room.

## Collision

The exported **Items** layer is the collision layer: its tiles carry `TILE_SOLID` where the player cannot walk. The player resolves that layer with the engine helper `pixelroot32::physics::isWorldPixelSolid`, which decodes the tile's 4bpp bitmap so a solid tile only blocks where its pixels are actually opaque — a tile whose bitmap has transparent "dead pixels" (palette index 0) lets the player walk through the gaps instead of treating the whole 16×16 cell as a wall.

The strategy is a **compile-time toggle** in `src/GameConstants.h`:

| `kCollisionMode` | Behaviour |
|------------------|-----------|
| `CollisionMode::WholeTile` | Original behaviour: a `TILE_SOLID` tile blocks its entire cell; the bitmap is ignored. |
| `CollisionMode::PerPixel` | Per-pixel test: transparent pixels are walkable, no erosion. |
| `CollisionMode::PerPixelEroded` *(default)* | Per-pixel test with morphological erosion, so thin branches, dangling 1px protrusions and stray opaque pixels on irregular tiles (plants, tree canopies) don't snag the player. |

`PerPixelEroded` uses `kTileSolidErosionPx` (default `1`) as the erosion radius: a pixel counts as solid only if the whole `(2*r+1)²` square around it is opaque.

`Player::canOccupy` branches on `kCollisionMode` with `if constexpr`, so the unselected branches are discarded at compile time (zero runtime cost, and on ESP32 the unused helper is stripped by `--gc-sections`). The helper is stateless — no per-tile masks, no allocations — so RAM cost is 0 in every mode.

## Build

From `gameplay/room_screen`:

```bash
pio run -e native
pio run -e esp32dev
```

## Upload (ESP32)

```bash
pio run -e esp32dev --target upload
```
