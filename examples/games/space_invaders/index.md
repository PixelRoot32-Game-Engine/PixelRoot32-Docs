A clone of the classic fixed-shooter, rebuilt on this engine as a teaching
demo: four rows of aliens marching down toward four degradable bunkers, one
bullet on screen at a time, three lives, and a bass line that speeds up as the
formation gets closer. The single idea it is about is **a fixed memory
budget**: the scene arena, the projectile pool, and the explosion slots are
all sized once at compile time, so a full game runs without a single runtime
allocation.

Language: C++17  
Engine: `gperez88/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine@^1.9.0`  
Environments: `native`, `esp32dev`

## Requirements (build flags)

Set in [`lib/platformio.ini`](lib/platformio.ini)'s `[base]` template, so
every environment inherits them:

- **`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_SCENE_ARENA`** — selects the arena path. With the flag
  set, every entity is placed with `arenaNew` into the scene's
  `SPACE_INVADERS_SCENE_ARENA_BUFFER` (4 KB, a file-scope array); without it
  the same code compiles to `std::unique_ptr` and the heap. Both branches are
  in [`src/SpaceInvadersScene.cpp`](src/SpaceInvadersScene.cpp), guarded by
  `#ifdef`, so the demo is also a side-by-side of the two ownership models.
  If the buffer runs out, `arenaNew` returns `nullptr` and the scene skips
  that entity rather than crashing.
- **`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_PHYSICS=1`** — required, not optional. `RigidActor`
  (projectiles), `KinematicActor` (the ship), `StaticActor` (bunkers) and the
  swept-collision helpers in `physics/CollisionSystem.h` all live behind this
  flag, so the demo does not compile without it.
- **`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_AUDIO=1`** — needed for the three-speed bass loop, the
  win/lose fanfares, and the shot/hit cues. Building without it is not a
  compile error — it is silence, and the tempo ramp that carries most of the
  tension disappears with it.
- **`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_PARTICLES=0`** — not used. Enemy hits are four
  one-pixel-wide bars drawn straight by the scene, and the player death is a
  three-frame sprite animation.
- **`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_UI_SYSTEM=0`** — the score and lives readouts are
  `Renderer::drawText` calls, not UI widgets.

Display size is **240×240** in the project `platformio.ini` (see
`PHYSICAL_DISPLAY_*`). Formation width, bunker spacing, and the ship's start
position are all derived from `DISPLAY_WIDTH` / `DISPLAY_HEIGHT` in
[`src/GameConstants.h`](src/GameConstants.h), so a different resolution
re-lays-out the screen instead of clipping it.

## Platforms

| Environment | Display | Audio backend |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **`native`** | SDL2, 240×240 | `SDL2_AudioBackend` in [`src/platforms/native.h`](src/platforms/native.h) |
| **`esp32dev`** | **ST7789** 240×240 | `ESP32_I2S_AudioBackend` in [`src/platforms/esp32_dev.h`](src/platforms/esp32_dev.h) |

Pin choices (ST7789 SPI, I2S audio, D-pad + two buttons) are in
`src/platforms/esp32_dev.h` — edit there if your wiring differs.

## Controls

| Action | `native` (keyboard) | `esp32dev` (GPIO) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Move ship | Left / Right arrows | D-pad Left / Right |
| Fire | Space | Button A |
| Restart (from Game Over) | Space | Button A |

The ship moves between **nine discrete lanes**, not freely: a tap steps one
lane, holding for 300 ms starts an arcade-style auto-repeat every 150 ms, and
each step is interpolated over 100 ms with an ease-out-cubic curve. Only one
player bullet may be in flight at a time, which is what makes aiming a
decision.

## What it demonstrates
- **Everything allocated once.** Twelve `ProjectileActor`s are constructed
  deactivated at reset and recycled by `reset()` for the rest of the game;
  enemy hit effects use eight fixed `EnemyExplosion` slots; the shooter
  candidate list in `enemyShoot()` is a stack array sized by `ALIEN_COLS`.
  Combined with the arena, nothing in `update()` reaches the allocator.
- **Swept-circle collision for fast, small targets.** A projectile at 80 px/s
  can pass through an 8-pixel alien between two frames. `ProjectileActor`
  keeps its `previousPosition`, and `handleCollisions()` runs
  `sweepCircleVsRect` from the previous position to the current one, falling
  back to a plain overlap test. Discrete tests alone would drop hits.
- **Animation driven by the game clock, not a frame timer.** Aliens never
  animate themselves: `AlienActor::update()` is empty, and the scene calls
  `move()` on every alien on each formation step, which advances position and
  `SpriteAnimation::step()` together. The whole formation therefore flips
  frames in perfect lockstep, which is the effect the original arcade cabinets
  got for free by redrawing one alien per step.
- **The music is the difficulty readout.** `updateMusicTempo()` maps the
  lowest living alien's Y to a tempo factor between 1.0 and 1.9, eased toward
  the target at 5 % per frame, and that same factor scales the formation's
  step timer. Sound and speed cannot drift apart because they read one number.
- **Two sprite paths from one animation type.** Squid and Octopus use
  single-colour `Sprite` frames; the Crab uses a `MultiSprite` — two 1bpp
  layers, body in orange and an eye highlight in white. `SpriteAnimationFrame`
  holds either, so `AlienActor::draw()` asks the animation which one it has
  and calls `drawSprite` or `drawMultiSprite` accordingly.
- **Damage as geometry.** A bunker's remaining health is drawn as remaining
  height, shrinking from the bottom up and shifting green to yellow to red.
  The hitbox shrinks with it, so a chewed-up bunker really does cover less.
- **A death that pauses the world.** A player hit starts a three-frame
  explosion and sets `isPaused`, which short-circuits `Scene::update()`
  entirely — aliens stop marching while the animation plays — then respawns
  the ship centred under the first surviving bunker.
